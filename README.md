# 🎬 Netflix NLP Recommender System

This project is a **content-based recommender system** for Netflix shows, built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. Users can enter a show title, and the app recommends 5 similar shows based on the show's description — using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Load and clean the Netflix dataset
2. Apply **TF-IDF Vectorization** to the `description` column
3. Compute **cosine similarity** between all shows
4. User inputs a title → app returns top 5 similar shows
